# _Zoo Pal!_

#### _An application that allows Zoo's to keep a database on their animals and can edit & update it live._

#### By _**Anduin Mooney**_

## Description

_This application allows the user to view animals based on their age, as well as viewing a database for every animal at a local zoo. The application allows employee's to add and update animals on the fly, and it's all done in live so there's no need to reload the page or go through multiple pages._

### _Possible Future Additions_

_If I were to continue working on this application, I would really like to tie this application with a Google Maps API, that way the user could view animals at their local zoo (Assuming of course the application is being used by multiple Zoo's). This would allow the user to instantly see details about animals in a zoo near them, instead of just a single Zoo. I would also like to add the ability to have multiple databases for different Zoos, so a user can view, add, and edit the animals from a completely different Zoo._
